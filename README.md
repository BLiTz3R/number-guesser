A simple JS number guesser.

- Player gets 3 attempts. He is notified of how many attempts are left each time.
- Winning number is always shown in the end.

v0.1: GUI and functionality done. Numbers are fixed and need to reload to start a new game.

v1.0: Winning number is random between 1 and 10. It now informs the player if the winning number is higher or lower than their guess. Turned the whole code to IIFE to avoid cheating.
