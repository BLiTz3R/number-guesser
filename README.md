# number-guesser
A simple JS number guesser.

- Player must guess a number between a min and a max.
- Player gets 3 attempts. He is notified of how many attempts are left each time.
- Winning number is always shown in the end.
- Player can choose to play again.

v0.1: GUI and functionality done. Numbers are fixed and need to reload to start a new game.

v0.2: Pretty much complete. Winning number is random between 1 and 20. Turned the whole code to IIFE to avoid cheating.
